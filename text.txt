This lists unique words and word frequencies occurring in a Python string.
You can ignore or take account of letter case in distinguishing words, and you can pass it your own inclusion list of characters allowed in words (e.g. is "import123" the kind of word you want to list, or not?  It might be if you're a programmer.)  By default only alpha chars are allowed in words.
